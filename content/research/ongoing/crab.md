__Abstract__

This paper analyzes how marine heatwaves (MHWs) affect the red king crab (RKC) fisheries in Norway. Drawing insights from similar events in the northeast Pacific and the Bering Sea, we first employ a socio-ecological systems (SES) model to understand how changes in RKC productivity and distribution due to MHWs could impact local fishing communities and economic activities in northern Norway. Subsequently, we assess the effects of identified marine heatwaves on the utilization of fishing permits specific to coastal vessels capable of catching red king crabs, as well as on the associated landing activities. This study is particularly relevant because the RKC fishery, though based on an introduced species, has become economically significant for coastal communities in northern Norway, supporting both commercial fishing and tourism activities.

- **ESP 168B Environmental Policy Analysis**
  - Undergraduate class, instructor: [James N. Sanchirico](https://jamesnsanchirico.com/)
  - Course description: The objective of the course is to provide students with an in-depth discussion on the pros and cons of evaluating the effect of policy/regulatory interventions using impact evaluation techniques. Topics will include development of causal chains, sample selection (random and non-random designs), internal vs. external validity, development of counterfactuals, and methods of evaluation. The methods will include randomized control trials, regression discontinuity, matching, difference in difference, and synthetic control estimates. We will investigate these methods in the context of evaluating the effectiveness of environmental policy and natural resource management. Applications include poverty alleviation, vehicle use restrictions, air pollution, protected area management, fishery management, toxic regulations, water conservation, and electricity and energy use.

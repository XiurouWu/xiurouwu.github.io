&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper analyzes how marine heatwaves (MHWs) affect the red king crab (RKC) fisheries in Norway. Drawing insights from similar events in the northeast Pacific and the Bering Sea, we first employ a socio-ecological systems (SES) model to understand how changes in RKC productivity and distribution due to MHWs could impact local fishing communities and economic activities in northern Norway. Subsequently, we assess the effects of identified marine heatwaves on the utilization of fishing permits specific to coastal vessels capable of catching red king crabs, as well as on the associated landing activities. This study is particularly relevant because the RKC fishery, though based on an introduced species, has become economically significant for coastal communities in northern Norway, supporting both commercial fishing and tourism activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper provides an upper-bound estimate of the potential short-run catch loss in tuna fisheries from potential large-scale marine protected areas in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean. We examine the hypothetical closures of the Galapagos EEZ of Ecuador and/or the Costa Rica Thermal Dome. Using a set level dataset of purse seine tuna fishing from 1996 to 2016, we  develop a method that decomposes the expected lost catch into two components: catch per set, number of sets in the potential area. This decomposition allows us to account for how protected areas and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) regimes differently impact various aspects of the production process. Our findings reveal significant heterogeneity in the expected impacts across vessel classes and fishing flags. Smaller vessels from certain flags would face substantial impacts from closing the Galapagos EEZ, while others would be more affected by closing the Costa Rica Thermal Dome. Additionally, we find that oceanographic conditions influence the magnitude of potential losses, with colder regimes leading to higher losses in the Galapagos EEZ and warmer regimes resulting in greater losses in the Costa Rica Thermal Dome. Our analysis contributes to the growing literature on large-scale ocean closures and provides a valuable tool for policymakers to better understand the distributional impacts of marine protected areas under varying oceanographic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sign restrictions provide a range of models that most economists agree upon.
In the recent years, additional proposals has been made including restrictions in dynamic factor models, narrative sign and ranking restrictions that can provide large and growing number of identifying inequalities resulting in point identification.
In this paper, we provide testable necessary and sufficient conditions under which these bounds collapse to single point.
The main necessary condition is positive linear dependence of the vectors of sign-restricted IRF coefficients.
We provide a simple test for this condition with standard chi-squared critical values that remain valid  in the presence of redundant sign-restrictions.
Our simulations suggest that the proposed test has high power against the alternative data generating process with partial-identification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: SVAR, point identification, sign restrictions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government monitoring and management collects private data that can become publicly accessible under transparent management. Meanwhile, technological advances have enabled novel sources of high-resolution mobility data that are inherently public. Together, these public data sources create opportunities for innovative digital platforms providing information services in the private sectors. This potential is exemplified in Norway&amp;rsquo;s fishing industry, where public access to fishing data has driven the development of digital platforms that aim for both sustainable fishing practices and energy efficiency.s driven the development of digital platforms that aim for both sustainable fishing practices and energy efficiency—critical objectives in the fishing industry&amp;rsquo;s efforts to adapt to and mitigate climate change. However, the value of information accessibility remains ambiguous, as better information may lead to increased fleet congestion in productive fishing grounds. Using natural experiments in Norwegian fisheries that altered the accessibility of public catch data, this paper analyzes how information availability affects fishing profit, fishing efficiency, and fleet congestion, focusing specifically on Norwegian bottom trawlers—the largest vessels in groundfish fisheries that face particular scrutiny for their carbon emissions and seabed impacts. This paper examines key sustainability metrics including bycatch rates, fuel consumption, carbon emissions, and seabed disturbance. This research provides insights into the trade-offs inherent in data transparency policies, particularly in the context of natural resource management where public sector data accessibility can drive private sector innovation while potentially affecting competitive dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
